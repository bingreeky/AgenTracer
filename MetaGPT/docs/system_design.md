## Implementation approach

We will implement a function that calculates the maximum product of an increasing subsequence in an array. The approach involves dynamic programming, where we maintain an array to store the maximum product for each element based on previous elements that are smaller.

## Data structures and interfaces:

classDiagram
    class MaxProduct {
        +max_product(arr: list[int]) -> int
    }

## Program call flow:

sequenceDiagram
    participant M as MaxProduct
    participant A as Array
    M->>A: max_product(arr)
    A-->>M: return max product
    M->>M: calculate maximum product using dynamic programming
    M-->>A: return final maximum product

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on specific edge cases or constraints for the input array.
